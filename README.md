# 3800 Project

Tic Tac Toe Project with Sockets in order to play with other people

# Running the program
> First, run the tictactoe.py file. This is considered the "server".
> 
> Second, run the tictactoeClient.py file. This is considered the "client".
> 
> Once the connection has been set up, the client will play as X and the server will play as O, with the client playing first.
> 
> The Client and Server will take turns, inputting the row and column of choice.
> 
> Play will continue until one side wins or a tie occurs. The program will end once either two cases happen.
